# Sentence-Segmentation


Find on Chrome Store: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sentence-segmenter/jfbhkblbhhigbgdnijncccdndhbflcha

This extension can help make your text easier to read by putting each sentence of a webpage on a new line (separated based on periods).

If you need to reread, it can be faster to find the beginning of sentences that all start on the left.

Sentence structure can also become clearer.

If youâ€™re skimming, you can abandon a sentence, and quickly find another sentence.

You can activate the segmentation by clicking on the top-right icon.

Additional notes:

Segmenting a page is like creating a snapshot.
Certain elements can't be clicked on and expanded anymore, like comment threads. 
Expand first if necessary, and then segment.

You can refresh the page to turn off the segmentation effect.

Spacing between sentences is similar to the Microsoft Word setting:
Microsoft Word -> Home -> Paragraph -> Indents and Spacing -> Spacing -> 
Line spacing single 
Before After 6 pt

To create a shortcut that activates the sentence segmenter, go to the extensions page (chrome://extensions/), and click on Keyboard Shortcuts at the bottom.
